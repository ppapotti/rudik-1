# RuDiK

This repository contains a Java implementation of RuDiK, a system for discovering of positive and negative logical rules over RDF knowledge graphs.
The prototype was first developed as a research project under the database group of Prof. Paolo Papotti at EURECOM, France.

The current implementation works against a Knowledge Graph specified as a http SPARQL endpoint, please have a look at the src/main/config/Configuration.xml on how to specify the http endpoint and various parameter of the system.

The folder src/test/java/asu.edu.rule_miner.rudik.dbpedia contains some example tests on how to run the system against DBPedia Knowledge Graph.

System Requirements: Maven 3.2 or above, Java 1.8 or above.

For a full technical report of RuDik and the algorithms involved, please refer to: http://www.eurecom.fr/en/publication/5321.
